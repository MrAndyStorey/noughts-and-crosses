# Noughts and Crosses
A Python implementation of Noughts and Crosses, aka Tic-Tac-Toe, using the CLI.  

It's a simple and fun game for 2 players (or 1 against the computer) that's played by placing either a X and O across a 3x3 grid with the goal of making it 3 in a row.

I've taken the logic described in the [Programming Pedagogy in Secondary Schools by the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/secondary-programming-pedagogy) so that the code is a run on from the exercise the pupils previously took part in during in Computational Thinking.

It also uses a range of **selection** (if) and **iteration** (for - definite/count controlled and while - indefinite/condition controlled) statements so that I can use and demonstrate it for other classes.

To run the game, simply type the following into your command line interface (CLI):
```
./game.py
```
